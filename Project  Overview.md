This is a binary classification convolutional neural network which differentiates between 'cancerous' and 'healthy' brain images.
The neural network was trained on 3680 images, with validation and testing sets having 460 images each.
The dataset for the project belongs to Preet Viradiya and was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/preetviradiya/brian-tumor-dataset
The project was developed using a Jupyter Notebook running on a Python 3 compiler.
The neural network was designed from scratch and has a light yet effective architecture.
Training accuracy was well over 99%, validation accuracy 96 %, and testing accuracy over 97%.
The results of the confusion matrix were also quite satisfactory.
